Vrinda Store Data Analysis

This project is my first hands-on experience with data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The objective of the project was to analyze sales data of Vrinda Store and extract meaningful insights that can support better business decisions.

Through this project, I focused on understanding customer behavior, sales performance across different regions, and the effectiveness of various online sales channels.

Project Overview

Vrinda Store wanted to gain clarity on:
• Which customers contribute the most to sales
• Which states and regions perform best
• Which online platforms generate maximum revenue
• How orders and deliveries are performing

Using Excel, I analyzed the dataset and presented the findings through charts and a dashboard to make the insights easy to understand for business users.

Tools and Techniques Used

Microsoft Excel was used for the complete analysis, including:
• Data cleaning and formatting
• Pivot tables for summarizing data
• Charts for visual analysis
• Dashboard creation for quick insights

Analysis Performed

The project includes analysis on:
• Monthly sales and order trends
• Gender-wise and age-group-wise customer behavior
• Order status such as delivered, cancelled, and returned
• Top-performing states by revenue
• Performance comparison of sales channels like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, and Ajio

Key Learnings

Working on this project helped me understand:
• How to transform raw data into useful insights
• How to use pivot tables effectively for analysis
• How to design simple dashboards for business users
• How data supports real business decisions

Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to:
• Recreate this project using Power BI
• Add profit and cost-based analysis
• Automate monthly reporting
• Explore forecasting using historical data
